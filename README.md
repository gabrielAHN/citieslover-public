# Newsletter through Scraping
Hello this respository allows you to scrape select web pages using selenium, scrape the data, formate it into html, and send that formated data through email to who ever you want. The pages are changable, and the configs for the email are left blank on purpose for you to place your info. Try it out and enjoy!
